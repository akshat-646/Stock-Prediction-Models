**Stock Price Prediction**
**Introduction**

This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning and deep learning models. It utilizes historical stock data such as opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume to forecast future prices. The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end predictive workflow — from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and visualization.

**Features**
The dataset used in this project includes the following attributes:

Date: The trading date.

Open: Opening price of the stock on a given day.

High: The highest price reached on that day.

Low: The lowest price reached on that day.

Close: The closing price of the stock.

Volume: The total number of shares traded on that day.

Predicted Close: The model’s forecast of the future closing price (target variable).

**Technology Used**

The project utilizes the following Python libraries for data processing, visualization, and prediction:

pandas – For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

numpy – For numerical and array-based operations.

matplotlib – For data visualization.

seaborn – For statistical plotting and EDA visualization.

scikit-learn – For data preprocessing and model evaluation metrics.

tensorflow / keras – For implementing and training the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network model.

yfinance – For fetching real-time and historical stock market data.

**Dataset**

The dataset is fetched using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance). You can specify a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, RELIANCE.NS, TCS.NS) to download its historical data for model training and prediction.
The time frame and interval can be adjusted as needed (e.g., 5 years of daily data).

**Workflow**
1. Import Libraries

All required libraries are imported at the beginning of the notebook for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.

2. Data Collection

Stock data is fetched directly using the yfinance API, allowing easy access to recent and historical market data.

3. Data Preprocessing

Steps include:

Handling missing values.

Selecting relevant features (Close price for prediction).

Normalizing data using MinMaxScaler for stable model performance.

Converting the time-series data into sequences suitable for LSTM input.

4. Data Visualization

Visualizations are created to better understand price trends and behavior:

Closing Price Trend over time.

Moving Averages (e.g., 50-day and 200-day averages).

Volume vs Price trends.

Correlation Heatmap among features.

5. Model Building

The model used is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network, capable of learning long-term temporal dependencies in time-series data.
Layers typically include:

Input layer with sequence data.

LSTM hidden layers for pattern extraction.

Dense output layer predicting future prices.

6. Model Training

The LSTM model is trained using the training data (e.g., 80% of total).
Parameters include epochs, batch size, and loss functions (e.g., Mean Squared Error).

7. Model Evaluation

The model’s performance is measured on the test set using metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R² Score

Results are visualized using:

Actual vs Predicted closing prices.

Line graphs comparing real and forecasted trends.

8. Future Prediction

The trained model is used to predict future closing prices based on the latest available data.
This can be visualized alongside historical trends for comparison.

Example Prediction:

Actual Closing Price (Today): ₹2,475.60  
Predicted Closing Price (Next Day): ₹2,492.35

9. Visualization of Results

Plots include:

Predicted vs Actual Closing Prices.

Training and Validation Loss Curves.

Price Trend Forecast for Upcoming Days.

**Usage**

To run the project:

Open Stock_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

**Future Enhancements**

Implement hybrid models combining LSTM with ARIMA or Prophet.

Integrate technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands).

Deploy the model using Flask or Gradio for a user-friendly web interface.

Support multi-stock comparison and real-time prediction.
